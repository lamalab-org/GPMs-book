    \caption{\textbf{Model Adaptation Approaches Overview:} This table provides a rough overview of the estimated time, data, and \gls{ml} knowledge required for each approach. Each method (listed in the first column) is paired with a triplet that includes: an approximate implementation time, the estimated dataset size, and the level of \gls{ml} expertise needed.  These estimates assume that you have at least a bachelor's level of understanding of chemistry and at least some computational background.}
