  name={supervised learning},
  description={In this \gls{mlg} paradigm, the model is trained on labeled data, learning to map inputs to known outputs.}
}

\newglossaryentry{sslg}{
  name={self-supervised learning}, 
  description={A \gls{mlg} technique that involves generating labels from the input data itself instead of relying on external labeled data. It has been foundational for the success of \glspl{llm}, as their pre-training task (next word prediction or filling in of masked words) is a self-supervised task.}
}

\newglossaryentry{ssmg}{
  name={selective state space model},
  description={A \glslink{nng}{neural architecture} that models sequential data using \glspl{latentstateg} and learned transitions, while \glslink{gatingg}{selectively controlling} which components of the state are updated at each step. SSMs aim to improve long-range reasoning and efficiency, and are used as alternatives to attention mechanisms in tasks like language modeling.}

\newglossaryentry{tokeng}{
  name={token},
  description={A basic unit of text used by \glspl{lmg}, typically corresponding to a word, subword, or character depending on the tokenizer. Models process and generate text as sequences of tokens.}
}

\newglossaryentry{transferabilityg}{
  name={transferability},
  description={The degree to which knowledge learned in one setting---such as a task, domain, or data distribution---can be effectively reused or adapted in another. High transferability indicates that representations or models generalize well to new contexts, and it is a key objective in \gls{transferlearningg}, foundation models, and general-purpose architectures.}
}


\newglossaryentry{transferlearningg}{
  name={transfer learning},
  description={In this \gls{mlg} paradigm, knowledge gained from one task or domain is reused to improve performance on a different, often related, task. Transfer learning typically involves pre-training a model on a large dataset and then fine-tuning it on a smaller, task-specific dataset, making it particularly valuable in low-data settings.}
}

\newglossaryentry{totg}{
  name={tree-of-thought},
  description={This \gls{promptingg} and reasoning framework extends \gls{cotg} by exploring multiple reasoning paths in a tree structure. ToT allows a model to evaluate and revise intermediate steps, enabling more deliberate decision-making in complex tasks.}
}


\newglossaryentry{unsupervisedg}{
  name={unsupervised learning},
  description={In this \gls{mlg} paradigm, the model is trained on unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structure, such as clusters or latent variables.}
}

\newglossaryentry{vlmg}{
  name={vision language model},
  description={A \glslink{modalityg}{multi-modal} model that can simultaneously learn from images and texts, generating text outputs.}
