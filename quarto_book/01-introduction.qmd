# Introduction

Much emphasis and hope is placed on \acr{ml} to accelerate the rate of scientific
progress.\[@jablonka2020big; @Butler_2018; @yano2022case; @Yao_2022;
@De_Luna_2017; @wang2023scientific\] Recent progress in the field has
demonstrated, for example, the ability of \acr{ml} models to make predictions for multiscale
systems,\[@charalambous2024holistic; @yang2020machine;
@Deringer_2021\] to perform experiments by interacting with laboratory
equipment \[@boiko2023autonomous; @coley2019robotic\], to autonomously
collect data from the scientific literature,\[@schilling2025text;
@zhang2024fine; @dagdelen2024structured\] and to make predictions with
high accuracy.\[@jablonka2024leveraging; @jablonka2023machine;
@jung2024automatic; @Rupp_2012; @Keith_2021; @Wu_2024\]

However, the diversity and scale of chemical data create a unique
challenge for applying \acr{ml} to the chemical sciences. This diversity
manifests across temporal, spatial, and representational dimensions.
Temporally, chemical processes span femtosecond-scale spectroscopic
events to year-long stability studies of pharmaceuticals or batteries,
demanding data sampled at resolutions tailored to each time regime.
Spatially, systems range from the atomic to the industrial scale,
requiring models that bridge molecular behavior to macroscopic
properties. Representationally, even a single observation (e.g., a
\^13C-NMR spectrum) can be encoded in chemically equivalent formats: a
string \[@alberts2024unraveling\], vector \[@mirza2024elucidating\], or
image\[@alberts2024unraveling\]. However, these representations are not
computationally equivalent and have been empirically shown to produce
diverse model outputs.\[@atz2024prospective; @alampara2024probing;
@wu2024t; @skinnider2024invalid\]

Additionally, \acr{ml} for
chemistry is challenged by what we term "hidden variables". These can be
thought of as the parameters in an experiment that remain largely
unaccounted for (e.g., their importance is unknown or they are difficult
to control for), but could have a significant impact on experimental
outcomes. One example are seasonal variations in ambient laboratory
conditions that are typically not controlled for and, if at all, only
communicated in private accounts.\[@Nega_2021\] In addition to that,
chemistry is believed to rely on a large amount of *tacit knowledge*,
i.e., knowledge that cannot be readily verbalized.\[@Taber_2014;
@Polanyi_2009\] Tacit chemical knowledge includes the subtle nuances of
experimental procedures, troubleshooting techniques, and the ability to
anticipate potential problems based on past experiences.

These factors---the diversity, scale, and tacity---clearly indicate that
the full complexity of chemistry cannot be captured using standard
approaches with bespoke representations based on structured
data.\[@jablonka2022making\] Fully addressing the challenges imposed by
chemistry requires the development of \acr{ml} systems that can handle diverse, "fuzzy",
data instances and have transferable capabilities to leverage low
amounts of data.\
*Foundation Models* are such models that can easily adapt to new
settings and deal with diverse, fuzzy inputs. The first comprehensive
description of such models was provided by @bommasani2021opportunities,
who also coined the term "foundation models". In the chemical
literature, this term has different connotations. We make the
distinction between \acr{gpm}s such as \acr{llm}s \[@zhang2024chemllm; @guo2025deepseek;
@openai2023gpt04; @anthropic2025system; @livne2024nach0;
@brown2020language\] and domain-specific models with
\acr{sota} performance
in a subset of tasks, such as machine-learning interatomic
potentials.\[@ahmad2022chemberta; @floge2024oneprot;
@batatia2023foundation; @Chen_2022; @unke2021machine\]

As we will show in the following, \acr{gpm}s---models designed to generalize across a
wide range of tasks and domains with minimal task-specific
modifications, typically pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets (see
[\[sec:taxonomy\]](#sec:taxonomy){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:taxonomy"})---are better equipped than domain-specific
models to leverage diverse, fuzzy inputs. Thus, this review article
focuses on their potential to shape the future of research in the
chemical sciences.\[@white2023future\]
