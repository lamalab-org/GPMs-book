# Accelerating Applications

The application of accelerated approaches in the scientific discovery
cycle (see
[\[fig:applications\]](#fig:applications){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="fig:applications"}) hinges on their ability to streamline and
enhance each stage of the process. However, a fundamental challenge in
effectively implementing these approaches lies in the choice of
machine-readable representation.

This challenge is particularly evident in the representation of
molecules and materials, which must balance computational efficiency
with the preservation of structural, compositional, and functional
properties. Take, for example, the high-temperature superconductor
YBa2Cu3O\_7-x. While atomic positions and coordinates are theoretically
sufficient to solve the Schrödinger equation and describe this material,
such a representation may not provide the adaptability necessary for
diverse tasks. What defines a good representation depends on the
problem. \[@huang2016understanding\]. A representation designed to
predict critical temperature must efficiently encode the relationship
between oxygen stoichiometry and superconducting properties, emphasizing
features like oxygen vacancy patterns and charge transfer mechanisms.
Conversely, a representation for structural stability might prioritize
different geometric or bonding characteristics.

This tension has led to three primary strategies for representing
molecules and materials (read
[\[sec:common_representations\]](#sec:common_representations){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:common_representations"} to learn in detail about the
different representations that currently exist). First, domain-specific
text-based formats---such as \acr{smiles} \[@weininger1988smiles\],
\acr{selfies}
\[@krenn2020self\], and \acr{cif} \[@hall1991crystallographic\]---offer
compact, machine-readable encodings of structural information. While
these necessarily omit certain physical details, their computational
tractability has enabled breakthroughs, as demonstrated by
@jablonka2024leveraging in their \acr{llm}-based generation of valid molecular and
material structures.

Yet, the question remains: Which representation is optimal for a given
task? Future advances in accelerated discovery will likely hinge on
adaptive representations that dynamically balance these competing
demands.

## Property Prediction {#sec:prediction}

\acr{gpm}s have emerged as
a powerful tool for predicting molecular and material properties,
offering an alternative to traditional quantum mechanical calculations
or specialized \acr{ml}
models. Current \acr{gpm}-driven property prediction tasks span
both classification and regression. Unlike conventional approaches that
rely on task-specific architectures and extensively labeled data,
\acr{gpm}s have
demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse domains,
efficiently adapting to various prediction tasks. Their success extends
to multiple datasets, from standardized benchmarks such as `MoleculeNet`
\[@wu2018moleculenet\], to curated datasets targeting specific
applications such as antibacterial activity
\[@chithrananda2020chemberta\] or photovoltaic
efficiency\[@aneesh2025semantic\].

Three key methodologies have been explored to adapt
\acr{llm}s for property
prediction: prompting techniques (see
[\[sec:prompting\]](#sec:prompting){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:prompting"}), fine-tuning (see
[\[sec:fine-tuning\]](#sec:fine-tuning){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:fine-tuning"}) on domain-specific data, and
\acr{rag} (see
[\[sec:rag\]](#sec:rag){reference-type="ref+Label" reference="sec:rag"})
approaches that combine \acr{llm}s with external knowledge bases.

generation; C = Classification; R = Regression
:::

### Prompting

Prompt engineering involves designing targeted instructions to guide
\acr{gpm}s in performing
specialized tasks without altering their underlying parameters by
leveraging their embedded knowledge. In molecular and materials science,
this strategy goes beyond simply asking a model to predict properties.
It also includes carefully structured prompts to elicit detailed
molecular and material descriptions directly from the model's
pre-trained knowledge.

@liu2025integrating conducted a comprehensive evaluation of different
prompting techniques to predict the properties of organic small
molecules and crystal materials. Some of these techniques included
domain-knowledge (prior knowledge was embedded in the prompt), expert
(role-play instructions), and few-shot \acr{cot} (the text*"Let's think step by step"* is
added) prompting. Of these, domain knowledge achieved maximum
performance. However, their evaluation was limited to a relatively small
set of molecules and tasks, and the effectiveness of their
domain-knowledge approach may not generalize to other molecular property
domains.

Building on these foundational prompting strategies, few-shot prompting
approaches leverage \acr{icl} to enhance performance through selected
examples @liu2024moleculargpt used \acr{smiles} string representations of molecules with
few-shot \acr{icl},
retrieving structurally similar molecules as demonstrations to enhance
property prediction. This approach highlights how
\acr{icl} can transfer
knowledge from similar molecule examples without requiring model
fine-tuning for each task. However, the effectiveness of
\acr{icl} depends on the
quality of retrieved examples.

@fifty2023incontext moved beyond direct text prompting of molecules and
introduced \acr{camp}:
an \acr{icl} algorithm
that uses a two-stage encoding approach without relying on pre-trained
\acr{llm}s. First, a
specialized \acr{mpnn}
encodes molecule graphs into molecular embeddings rather than processing
them as raw text. These embeddings are then fed into a transformer
encoder, which learns contextualized representations across the support
set (a small collection of labeled molecule-property pairs) and the
unlabeled query molecules. They demonstrated \acr{camp}'s ability to outperform existing few-shot
learning baselines by providing relevant molecular examples within the
prompt context. However, this approach is constrained by the
context-length limitations of the underlying \acr{lm}s and the challenge of selecting optimal
demonstration examples.

More sophisticated approaches have leveraged prompting as part of
multi-modal frameworks. The `LLM4SD` pipeline by @zheng2025large
employs specialized prompts to guide \acr{lm}s through their pre-trained knowledge on
scientific literature, generating known rules (e.g., molecules weighing
under 500 Da are more likely to pass the blood-brain barrier) that
transform molecules into feature vectors (e.g. CCO could translate to a
vector $[2,46.07,1,1]$ where each number represents a feature of the
molecule, in this example \[# C, MW, \# H-bond donors, \# H-bond
acceptors\]) for use with a random forest model, which they consider
"interpretable". This approach outperformed specialized
\acr{sota} models across
$58$ benchmark tasks, while providing interpretable reasoning about
prediction logic (see
[\[tab:property_prediction_models\]](#tab:property_prediction_models){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="tab:property_prediction_models"} for properties predicted by
this model). However, its reliance on rule extraction may limit its
ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships that specialized
deep learning models can identify.

#### \acr{llm}s as Feature Extractors

Another emerging application of \acr{llm}s is their use as "feature extractors", where
they generate textual or embedded representations of molecules or
materials. For instance, in materials science, @aneesh2025semantic
employed \acr{llm}s to
generate text embeddings of perovskite solar cell compositions. These
embeddings were subsequently used to train a \acr{gnn} for predicting power conversion
efficiency, demonstrating the potential of \acr{llm}s to enhance feature representation in
materials informatics. Similarly, in the molecular domain,
@srinivas2024crossmodal used zero-shot \acr{llm} prompting (see
[\[box: cot_prompting\]](#box: cot_prompting){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="box: cot_prompting"} for prompt examples) to generate
detailed textual descriptions of molecular functional groups, which are
used to train a small \acr{lm}. This \acr{lm} is used to compute text-level embeddings
of molecules. Simultaneously, they generate molecular graph-level
embeddings from \acr{smiles} string molecular graph inputs. They
finally integrate the graph and text-level embeddings to produce a
semantically enriched embedding.

<img src="media/eq_images/cot_prompting.png" alt="Promptbox: box: cot_prompting" / width="100%">

In a different implementation of fine-tuning, @balaji2023gptmolberta
used `ChatGPT` to generate text descriptions of molecules that were then
used to train a `RoBERTa` (125M) model for property prediction, showing
how \acr{lm}-generated
representations can access latent spaces that
\acr{smiles} strings
alone might not capture. Similarly, @li2024unveiling introduced the
`MoleX` framework, which fine-tunes `ChemBERTa-2`\[@ahmad2022chemberta\]
on Group \acr{selfies} \[@cheng2023group\] (a functional
group-based molecular representation) to then extract a single
\acr{llm}-derived
embedding of molecules that captures the chemical semantics at the
functional group level. This allowed them to determine which functional
groups or fragments contribute to molecular properties, which in turn
can be converted into reliable explanations of said properties.

### Fine-Tuning {#sec:prediction_FT}

<figure id="fig:gptchem">
<img src="media/figures/property_gptchem.png" alt="" / width="100%">

search match (dark red). The dashed line shows performance using random
forest. <code>GPT-3</code> achieves comparable accuracy to traditional
approaches with significantly fewer training examples. Data adapted from
@jablonka2024leveraging</figcaption>
</figure>

#### \acr{lift}

@dinh2022lift showed that reformulating regression and classification
as \acr{qa} tasks enables
the use of unmodified model architecture while improving performance
(see [\[sec:fine-tuning\]](#sec:fine-tuning){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:fine-tuning"} for a deeper discussion of
\acr{lift}). In
recognizing the scarcity of experimental data and acknowledging the
persistence of this limitation, @jablonka2024leveraging designed a
\acr{lift}-based
framework using `GPT-3` fine-tuned on task-specific small datasets (see
[\[tab:property_prediction_models\]](#tab:property_prediction_models){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="tab:property_prediction_models"}). They seminally
demonstrated that fine-tuned `GPT-3` can match or surpass specialized
\acr{ml} models in various
chemistry tasks. A key finding was fine-tuned `GPT-3`'s ability to
generalize beyond training data. When tested on compounds absent from
Google Search (and likely its training data), it performed well, proving
that it was not simply recalling memorized information (see
[1](#fig:gptchem){reference-type="ref+Label" reference="fig:gptchem"}).

In a follow-up to @jablonka2024leveraging's work,
@vanherck2025assessment systematically evaluated this approach across
22 diverse real-world chemistry case studies using three open-source
models. They demonstrate that fine-tuned \acr{llm}s can effectively predict various material
properties. For example, they achieved $96\%$ accuracy in predicting the
adhesive free-energy of polymers, outperforming traditional
\acr{ml} methods like
random forest ($90\%$ accuracy). When predicting properties of monomers
using \acr{smiles}
notation, the fine-tuned models reached average accuracies of $84\%$
across four different properties. Particularly notable was the ability
of \acr{llm}s to work with
non-standard inputs, like in a protein phase separation study they did,
where raw protein sequences could be directly input without
pre-processing and achieve $95\%$ prediction accuracy. At the same time,
when training datasets were very small (15 data points), the predictive
accuracy of all fine-tuned models was lower than the random baseline
(e.g. MOF synthesis). These case studies preliminarily demonstrate that
these models can achieve predictive performance with some small
datasets, work with various chemical representations
(\acr{smiles},
\acr{mof}id, and
\acr{iupac} names), and
can outperform traditional \acr{ml} approaches for some material property
prediction tasks.

In the materials domain, `LLMprop` fine-tunes
`T5`\[@raffel2020exploring\] to predict crystalline material properties
from text descriptions generated by
`Robocrystallographer`\[@ganose2019robocrystallographer\]. By discarding
`T5`'s decoder and adding task-specific prediction heads, the approach
reduces computational overhead while leveraging the model's ability to
process structured crystal descriptions. The method demonstrates that
natural language representations can effectively capture key material
features, offering an alternative to traditional graph-based models like
\acr{gnn}s.

Fine-tuning has been used to adapt \acr{ssm}s like Mamba (see
[\[sec:example_architectures\]](#sec:example_architectures){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:example_architectures"}). By pre-training on 91 million
molecules, the Mamba-based model
$\text{O}_{SMI}-{\text{SSM}-}336\textit{M}$ outperformed transformer
methods (`Yield-BERT`\[@krzyzanowski2025exploring\]) in reaction yield
prediction (e.g., Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling) and achieved
competitive results in molecular property prediction
benchmarks.\[@soares2025mamba-based\]

#### Foundational \acr{gnn}s and \acr{mlip}s

The fine-tuning approach has been applied to "foundational
\acr{gnn}s"
\[@sypetkowski2024scalability; @shoghi2023molecules\] and
\acr{mlip}s, approaches
distinct from \acr{gpm}s.
For example, \[@shoghi2023molecules; @sypetkowski2024scalability\] show
\acr{sota} performance
on property prediction tasks. "Foundational"
\acr{mlip}s pre-trained on
large datasets encompassing many chemical elements can be fine-tuned for
specific downstream tasks \[@batatia2022mace\], such as calculating
sublimation enthalpies of molecular crystal polymorphs
\[@kaur2025data\].

#### Limitations

One central challenge is finding balance in datasets. In practical
applications, researchers often have many more examples of
poor-performing materials than optimal ones, resulting in unbalanced
datasets that can diminish model performance. @vanherck2025assessment
point out that in the catalyzed cleavage reaction study, only $3.8\%$ of
catalysts were labeled as "good", forcing researchers to reduce their
training set significantly to maintain balance. They also note that
\acr{llm}s struggle with
highly complex or noisy datasets, as seen in their study of catalytic
isomerization, where even after hyperparameter optimization, the models
failed to achieve meaningful predictive power due to the high noise in
the experimental data and limited sample size. Finally, they note that
although \acr{llm}s can
work with different chemical representations, the choice of
representation significantly impacts performance. For example, when
predicting polymerization rates, models using
\acr{smiles} notation
significantly outperformed those using \acr{iupac} names, indicating that representation
selection remains an important consideration.

Fine-tuning effectively adapts \acr{llm}s to specialized chemistry tasks, but its
dependence on static datasets hinders adaptability to new or evolving
knowledge. \acr{rag},
whose fundamentals are described in detail in
[\[sec:rag\]](#sec:rag){reference-type="ref+Label" reference="sec:rag"},
overcomes these limitations by dynamically integrating external data
sources, enabling more flexible and up-to-date reasoning.

### Agents

Caldas Ramos et al. introduce `MAPI-LLM`, a framework that processes
natural-language queries about material properties using an
\acr{llm} to decide which
of the available tools such as the Materials Project
\acr{api}, the
Reaction-Network package, or Google Search to use to generate a
response. \[@Jablonka2023\] `MAPI-LLM` employs a
\acr{react} prompt (see
[\[sec:arch_agents\]](#sec:arch_agents){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:arch_agents"} to read more about
\acr{react}), to
convert prompts such as *"Is $Fe_2O_3$ magnetic?"* or *"What is the band
gap of Mg(Fe3O3)2?"* into queries for Materials Project
\acr{api}. The system
processes multi-step prompts through logical reasoning, for example,
when asked *"If Mn2FeO3 is not metallic, what is its band gap?"*, the
\acr{llm} system creates
a two-step workflow to first verify metallicity before retrieving the
band gap.

Building on this foundation of agent-based materials querying,
@chiang2024llamp advanced the approach with `LLaMP`, a framework that
employs "hierarchical" \acr{react} agents to interact with computational and
experimental data. This "hierarchical" framework employs a
supervisor-assistant agent architecture where a complex problem is
broken down and tasks are delegated to domain-specific agents. `LLaMP`
addresses the challenge of hallucinations more effectively than standard
\acr{llm} approaches by
grounding responses in retrieved materials databases, retrieving
materials data (e.g., crystal structures, elastic tensors) while
counteracting systematic \acr{llm} biases in property predictions. These
biases include the tendency for \acr{llm}s to overestimate certain properties like
bulk moduli and to exhibit errors in bandgap predictions based on
compositional patterns learned during training rather than physical
principles.

### Core Limitations {#sec:property_core_limits}

<figcaption><strong>Normalized error distributions for materials

models including <code>CrabNet</code>. [@Wang_2021] Lower values

@alampara2024mattext</figcaption>
</figure>

@alampara2024mattext introduced `MatText`, a framework for evaluating
\acr{lm}s ability to predict
properties of materials using text-based representations. Their findings
indicate that current \acr{llm}s (including pre-trained `BERT` and
fine-tuned `LLaMA-3-8B`) are effective for tasks relying purely on
compositional information (e.g., element types and local bonding
patterns), but struggle to leverage geometric or positional information
encoded in text, as reflected in
[2](#fig:property_limitations){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="fig:property_limitations"}. This observation suggests that
transformer-based architectures may be fundamentally limited to
applications where spatial understanding is not required. Their
experiments with data scaling and text representations reveal that
increasing pre-training data or adding geometric details fails to
improve downstream property prediction, challenging the conventional
assumption that larger models and datasets universally enhance
performance. \[@frey2023neural\] Notably, @frey2023neural demonstrated
power-law scaling in chemical \acr{llm}s, but `MatText`'s results imply that such
scaling may not overcome architectural biases against geometric
reasoning in materials tasks.\[@gruver2024promises\]

## Molecular and Material Generation {#sec:mol_generation}

<figure id="fig:generation">
<img src="media/figures/rescaled_figures/chemrev_figure21.png" alt="" / width="100%">
<figcaption><strong>Pipeline for molecular and materials
generation</strong> The workflow begins with input structures
represented in various formats, which are used to train <span

models to generate novel molecular and material structures. The
generated structures should undergo a feedback loop through validation
processes before being applied in the real world. Blue boxes indicate
well-established areas of the pipeline with mature methodologies, while
the red box represents critical bottlenecks.</figcaption>
</figure>

Early work in molecular and materials generation relied heavily on
unconditional generation, where models produce novel structures without
explicit guidance, relying solely on patterns learned from training
data. For example, latent space sampling in autoencoders, where random
vectors are decoded into new structures.\[@yoshikai2024novel\] These
methods excel at exploring chemical space broadly but lack fine-grained
control. This limitation underscores the need for conditional
generation, using explicit prompts or constraints (e.g., property
targets, structural fragments), to steer \acr{gpm}s toward meaningful molecule or material
designs. Beyond the generation step, as
[3](#fig:generation){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="fig:generation"} shows, critical bottlenecks persist in
synthesizability and physical consistency at the validation stage.

### Generation {#sec:generation}

#### Prompting

While zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies demonstrate promising
flexibility for molecule generation, benchmark studies \[@guo2023large\]
reveal significant limitations that restrict their practical utility.
@guo2023large exposed fundamental gaps in \acr{llm}s' molecular design capabilities through a
systematic evaluation. `GPT-4` was reported to produce chemically valid
\acr{smiles} $89\%$ of
the time but achieving less than $20\%$ accuracy in matching the target
specifications. This result is far below specialized models like
`MolT5`\[@edwards2022translation\]. They conclude that this performance
gap stems from \acr{llm}s'
inadequate understanding of \acr{smiles} syntax and structure-property
relationships. Subsequent work by @bhattacharya2024large explored
whether systematic prompt engineering could overcome these limitations,
demonstrating that these prompts could guide `Claude 3 Opus` to generate
chemically valid molecules ($97\%$ syntactic validity) with controlled
modifications, including fine-grained structural changes (median
Tanimoto similarity $0.67$--$0.69$) and predictable electronic property
shifts (0.14 eV--0.27 eV \acr{homo} energy changes). Hybrid approaches like
`FrontierX` extend this method with knowledge-augmented prompting, where
\acr{llm}s generate both
molecule predictions and explanations that are used to fine-tune smaller
\acr{lm}s, with all
resulting embeddings ultimately combined via hierarchical attention
mechanisms to produce the final \acr{smiles} representation\[@srinivas2024crossing\].
It showed improved accuracy over pure prompting strategies but
sacrificed the generalizability that makes \acr{llm}s attractive, as the model requires
re-training for each new molecular domain.

#### Fine-Tuning {#fine-tuning}

To overcome the limitations of prompting, fine-tuning has been adopted
in molecular and materials generation, much like its use in property
prediction with \acr{lift}-based frameworks (see
[\[sec:fine-tuning\]](#sec:fine-tuning){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:fine-tuning"} for a deeper explanation of
\acr{lift} and
[1.1.2](#sec:prediction_FT){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:prediction_FT"} for a discussion of
\acr{lift} applied to
property prediction tasks). @yu2024llasmol demonstrated that systematic
fine-tuning in various chemical tasks including molecule generation from
captions can improve performance while remaining parameter-efficient,
using only $0.58\%$ of trainable parameters via
\acr{lora}.

The molecule-caption translation task (`Mol2Cap`), which involves
generating textual descriptions from molecular representations and vice
versa (Cap2Mol), has become a standard benchmark for evaluating
\acr{gpm}s for molecule
generation. \[@edwards2022translation\] Under the "Mol2Cap"/"Cap2Mol"
task paradigm, \acr{icma} avoids domain-specific pre-training by
combining retrieval-augmented in-context learning with fine-tuning on
\acr{icl}
examples.\[@li2025large\] On the ChEBI-20\[@edwards2021text2mol\] and
PubChem324k\[@liu2023molca\] datasets, \acr{icma} nearly doubles baseline performance, with
\acr{icma} powered
by`Mistral-7B` achieving a 0.581 \acr{bleu} score in `Mol2Cap` and $46.0\%$ exact
match in `Cap2Mol`.\[@li2025large\] However, its reliance on retrieved
examples raises concerns about generalization to novel scaffolds.
Similarly, `MolReFlect` enhances fine-grained alignment through a
teacher-student framework, where a larger \acr{llm} (e.g., `GPT-4`) extracts
substructure-aware captions to guide a smaller model (`Mistral-7B`),
improving `Cap2Mol` accuracy while reducing
hallucinations.\[@li2024molreflect\] Meanwhile, `PEIT-LLM` extends the
task to property-conditioned generation, using instructions
(\acr{smiles}-text-property tuples) to optimize for
captioning and prediction jointly.\[@lin2025property\]

Fine-tuned \acr{lm}s have
shown promise in molecule and materials generation. However, their
reliance on decoding and \acr{smiles}/\acr{selfies} representations introduces fundamental
limitations: degeneracy (multiple valid \acr{smiles} for the same molecule) and difficulty
capturing complex structural relationships implicit in textual
descriptions.

#### Diffusion and Flow Matching

Diffusion and flow-based models operate directly on latent
representations, enabling more flexible generation of diverse and novel
structures.\[@zhu20243m-diffusion\] Moreover, emerging hybrid
architectures combine the strengths of \acr{llm}s with diffusion and flow matching models to
overcome the limitations of each paradigm individually
\[@sriram2024flowllm\].

Beyond text-based representations, `llamole` introduced a multimodal
\acr{llm} approach
capable of text and graph generation by integrating a base
\acr{llm} with graph
diffusion transformers and graph neural networks for multi-conditional
molecular generation and retrosynthetic planning. Specifically they used
different trigger (`<design>` and `<retro>`) and query (`<query>`)
tokens for switching between them and improved success in synthesis
success rates from $5\%$ to $35\%$ . \[@liu2024multimodal\]

A unique challenge with crystalline materials is generating a material
that possesses both discrete (atom type) and continuous (atomic position
and lattice geometry) variables. @sriram2024flowllm developed `FlowLLM`
to address this challenge. They recognized that the respective strengths
of \acr{llm}s, modeling
discrete values and conditional prompting, and denoising models,
modeling continuous values and equivariances, could be combined to
create a hybrid architecture. A fine-tuned \acr{llm} is used to learn an effective base
distribution of metastable crystals via text-based representations,
which is then iteratively refined through \acr{rfm} to optimize atomic coordinates and
lattice parameters.\[@sriram2024flowllm\]

#### Reinforcement Learning and Preference Optimization

Translating \acr{gpm}
generated outputs to the real world requires designing molecules and
materials with specific target properties. \acr{rl} and preference optimization
techniques\[@lee2024fine-tuning\] have emerged as powerful solutions for
this challenge. For instance, @jang2025can combined
\acr{sft} and
\acr{rl} using
\acr{ppo} to generate
diverse molecular sequences auto-regressively. This approach excels in
exploring a broad chemical space, but incurs high computational costs
due to its reliance on iterative, sequence-based generation. In
contrast, @cavanagh2024smileyllama employed \acr{dpo} with \acr{sft} to fine-tune \acr{llm}s for molecular design, leveraging
\acr{smiles}
representations to optimize drug-like properties (e.g., hydrogen bond
donors/acceptors and LogP). While \acr{dpo} reduces computational overhead in
comparison to \acr{ppo},
it trades off molecular diversity, a key strength of the work by
@jang2025can, due to the inherent constraints of preference-based
fine-tuning.

Beyond these methods, \acr{era} introduces a different optimization
paradigm. \[@chennakesavalu2025aligning\] Unlike
\acr{ppo} or
\acr{dpo},
\acr{era} uses
gradient-based objectives to guide word-by-word generation with explicit
reward functions, converging to a physics-inspired probability
distribution that allows fine control over the generation process. In
single-property optimization tasks, \acr{era} successfully aligned molecular
transformers to generate compounds with targeted chemical properties
(QED, LogP, ring count, molar refractivity) while maintaining $59-84\%$
chemical validity without regularization. For multi-objective
optimization, it achieved precise control over property trade-offs using
weighted energy functions.

@calanzone2025mol-moe also address the challenge of multi-objective
molecular generation with `MOL-MOE`, a \acr{moe} framework (see
[\[sec:arch-moes\]](#sec:arch-moes){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:arch-moes"} to learn more about \acr{moe} architectures). `MOL-MOE` dynamically
combines property-specific expert models at test time using
preference-guided routers toward drug-relevant molecular properties
enabling flexible steering across multiple objectives without
re-training. Compared to alternatives like
`MORLHF`\[@zhou2024one-preference-fits-all\], \acr{sft} with rewards-in-context, and simple model
merging such as Rewarded Soups\[@rame2023rewarded\]), `MOL-MOE` achieves
superior performance in both property optimization and
steerability---particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios where other
methods struggle.

`CrystalFormer-RL` uses \acr{rl} fine-tuning to optimize
`CrystalFormer`\[@cao2024space\], a transformer-based crystal generator,
with rewards from discriminative models (e.g., property
predictors)\[@cao2025crystalformer-rl\]. \acr{rl} improves stability (lower energy above
convex hull) and enables property-guided generation (e.g., high
dielectric constant + band gap). Here, \acr{rl} fine-tuning is shown to outperform
supervised fine-tuning, enhancing both novel material discovery and
retrieval of high-performing candidates from the pre-training dataset.

#### Agents

Agent-based frameworks leveraging \acr{llm}s, deeply explained in
[\[sec:agents\]](#sec:agents){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:agents"}, have emerged as approaches for autonomous
molecular and materials generation, demonstrating capabilities that
extend beyond simple prompting or fine-tuning by incorporating iterative
feedback loops, tool integration, and human-\acr{ai} collaboration. The `dZiner` framework
implements this approach for the inverse design of materials, where
agents input initial \acr{smiles} strings with optimization task
descriptions and generate validated candidate molecules by retrieving
domain knowledge from the literature.\[@ansari2024dziner\] It also uses
domain-expert surrogate models to evaluate the required property in the
new molecule/material. These surrogate models are highly customizable to
the desired property and give the user the option to train their own
\acr{ml} model or using an
existing \acr{sota}
model. @ansari2024dziner demonstrated `dZiner`'s capabilities in
generating surfactants for critical micelle concentration reduction,
WDR5 inhibitors, and optimizing \acr{mof} organic linkers for CO2 adsorption. The
`CLADD` framework adopts a \acr{rag}-enhanced multi-agent approach where
specialized teams including "Planning", "Knowledge Graph", and
"Molecular Understanding" collaborate to dynamically retrieve and
integrate external biochemical knowledge for drug discovery tasks
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning.\[@lee2025rag-enhanced\]

### Validation

#### General validation

The most fundamental validation approaches use cheminformatics tools
like `RDKit` to verify molecular validity. `RDKit` provides robust tools
for validating molecules through its ability to parse and sanitize
molecules from \acr{smiles} strings. If a step in the
\acr{smiles} to
structure conversion process fails, then the molecule is considered
invalid. More sophisticated validation involves quantum mechanical
calculations to compute molecular properties such as formation
energies\[@kingsbury2022flexible\]. These computationally expensive
operations provide deeper insights into whether generated structures are
viable. Models are also evaluated for their ability to generate unique
molecules by calculating the proportion of unique molecules in generated
sets, often using molecular fingerprints or structural descriptors.

The gold standard for validation is experimental synthesis, but
significant gaps exist between computational generation and laboratory
realization. Preliminarily, metrics like Tanimoto similarity and Fréchet
ChemNet distance \[@preuer2018frechet\] quantify structural resemblance,
which can indicate synthetic feasibility when training data consists of
known compounds. Retrosynthesis prediction algorithms attempt to bridge
this gap by evaluating synthetic accessibility and proposing potential
synthesis routes (see
[1.3](#sec:retrosynthesis){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:retrosynthesis"}). However, these methods still face
limitations in accurately predicting real-world synthesizability
\[@zunger2019beware\].

#### Conditional Generation Validation

Beyond establishing the general validity of generated molecules,
evaluation methods can assess both their novelty relative to training
data and their ability to meet specific design goals. For inverse design
tasks, such as optimizing binding affinity or solubility, the *de novo*
molecule generation benchmark GuacaMol differentiates between
*distribution-learning* (e.g., generating diverse, valid molecules) and
*goal-directed* optimization (e.g., rediscovering known drugs or meeting
multi-objective constraints) \[@brown2019guacamol\]. In the materials
paradigm, frameworks such as `MatBench Discovery` evaluate analogous
challenges such as stability, electronic properties, and
synthesizability, but adapt metrics to periodic systems, such as energy
above hull or band gap prediction accuracy\[@riebesell2025framework\].
Recently, they introduced the "discovery acceleration factor", which
quantifies how effective a model is at finding stable structures
relative to a random baseline.

## Retrosynthesis {#sec:retrosynthesis}

The practical utility of \acr{gpm}s for generating molecules and materials
remains limited by a persistent gap in their synthetic feasibility.
Early work by @schwaller2021mapping laid important groundwork by
demonstrating how attention-based neural networks can learn meaningful
representations of chemical reactions, enabling accurate classification
and prediction of reaction outcomes. Their model, trained on millions of
reactions from patent and literature data, showed that learned reaction
embeddings were capable of capturing nuanced chemical relationships.

Recent efforts have built on this foundation by integrating
synthesizability directly into molecular and materials generation
pipelines that leverage both domain-specific tools and
\acr{gpm}s. For example,
@sun2025synllama adapted `Llama-3.1-8B` and `Llama-3.2-1B` to predict
retrosynthetic pathways and identify commercially available building
blocks for experimentally validated SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors.
Similarly, @liu2024multimodal introduced a multimodal framework that
combines reaction databases with chemical intuition encoded in
\acr{llm}s, improving the
prioritization of high-yield, low-cost synthetic routes.

More recent work has explored how fully fine-tuned
\acr{llm}s can serve as
comprehensive chemistry assistants for experimental guidance.
@zhang2025large used a two-stage training process to first develop
`Chemma-\acr{SFT}` by fine-tuning `LLaMA-2-7B` on 1.28 million chemical
reaction question-answer pairs about reaction prediction, single-step
retrosynthesis, and reaction condition generation tasks. In the second
stage of training, they developed `Chemma-RM` using
\acr{rlhf} and applied
it to optimize the experimental reaction conditions. `Chemma`
successfully optimized an unreported Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling
reaction within only 15 experimental runs.

Predictive retrosynthesis has also extended to the inorganic domain.
@kim2024large demonstrated that fine-tuned `GPT-3.5` and `GPT-4` can
predict both the synthesizability of inorganic compounds from their
chemical formulas and select appropriate precursors for synthesis,
achieving performance comparable to specialized \acr{ml} models with minimal development time and
cost. In a follow-up work, they extended this approach to
structure-based predictions of inorganic crystal polymorphs, where
\acr{llm}s provided
human-readable explanations for their synthesizability
assessments\[@kim2025explainable\]. Notably, their structure-aware
models correctly identified twelve hypothetical compounds as
non-synthesizable despite their thermodynamic stability, perfectly
matching experimental outcomes where synthesis attempts failed.

Beyond retrosynthetic prediction, \acr{llm}s have also been deployed as reasoning
engines for autonomous design. @bran2024augmenting developed
`ChemCrow`, an \acr{llm}-based system that autonomously plans and
executes the synthesis of novel compounds by integrating specialized
tools like a retrosynthesis planner (see
[\[sec:planning\]](#sec:planning){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:planning"} to read more about this capability of
`ChemCrow` and its limitations) and reaction predictors. This approach
mirrors the iterative experimental design cycle employed by human
chemists, but is equipped with the scalability of automation. Notably,
systems like `ChemCrow` rely on high-quality reaction data to ground
their reasoning in empirically viable chemistry, which, depending on the
design space, could be a limitation.

<code>logP</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

Discovering novel compounds and reactions in chemistry and materials
science has long relied on iterative trial-and-error processes rooted in
existing domain knowledge \[@Taylor2023brief\]. While, as explained in
[1.3](#sec:retrosynthesis){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:retrosynthesis"}, those methods are used to accelerate
this process, optimization methods help improve conditions, binding
affinity, etc. But these approaches are slow and labor-intensive.
Traditional data-driven methods aimed to address these limitations by
combining predictive \acr{ml} models with optimization frameworks such
as \acr{bo} or
\acr{ea}s. These frameworks
balance exploration of uncharted regions in chemical space with
exploitation of known high-performing regions \[@Li2024sequential;
@Hse2021gryffin; @Shields2021bayesian; @Griffiths2020constrained;
@RajabiKochi2025adaptive\].

Recent advances in \acr{llm}s have unlocked potential for addressing
optimization challenges in chemistry and related domains
\[@fernando2023promptbreeder0; @yang2023large; @chen2024instruct\]. A
key strength of \acr{llm}s
lies in their capacity to frame optimization tasks through natural
language, which enhances knowledge incorporation, improves candidate
comparisons, and increases interpretability. This aligns well with
chemical problem-solving, where complex phenomena, such as reaction
pathways or material behaviors, are often poorly captured by standard
nomenclature; however, they can still be intuitively explained through
natural language. Moreover, \acr{gpm}s' general capabilities provide flexibility
beyond classical methods, which have to be trained from scratch if the
optimization problem or any of its variables changes. By encoding
domain-specific knowledge---including reaction rules, thermodynamic
principles, and structure-property relationships---into structured
prompts, \acr{llm}s can
synergize expertise with their ability to navigate complex chemical
optimization problems.

Current \acr{llm}
applications in chemistry optimization vary in scope and methodology.
Many studies integrate \acr{llm}s into \acr{bo} frameworks, where models guide
experimental design by predicting promising candidates
\[@rankovic2023bochemian\]. Others employ \acr{ga}s or hybrid strategies that combine
\acr{llm}-generated
hypotheses with computational screening \[@cisse2025language0based\].

### LLMs as Surrogate Models

A prominent \acr{llm}-driven strategy positions these models as
surrogate models within optimization loops. Typically implemented as
\acr{gpr}, surrogate
models learn from prior data to approximate costly feature-outcome
landscapes, which are often computationally and time-consuming to
evaluate, thereby guiding the acquisition. \acr{llm}s offer major advantages in this role
primarily through strong low-data performance. Their
\acr{icl} capability
enables task demonstration with minimal prompt examples while leveraging
chemical knowledge from pre-training to generate accurate predictions.
This allows \acr{gpm}s to
compensate for sparse experimental data effectively.

@ramos2023bayesian demonstrated the viability of this paradigm through
a simple yet effective framework that combines \acr{icl} using only one example in the prompt with
a \acr{bo} workflow. Their
\acr{bo}-\acr{icl} approach uses few-shot examples formatted
as question-answer pairs, where the \acr{llm} generates candidate solutions conditioned
on prior successful iterations. These candidates are ranked using an
acquisition function, with top-$k$ selections integrated into subsequent
prompts to refine predictions iteratively. Remarkably, this method
achieved high performance in optimizing catalytic reaction conditions,
even matching the top-1 accuracies observed in experimental benchmarks.
This emphasizes the potential of \acr{llm}s as accessible, \acr{icl} optimizers when coupled with
well-designed prompts.

To address limitations in base \acr{llm}s' inherent chemical knowledge---particularly
their grasp of specialized representations like
\acr{smiles} or
structure-property mappings---@yu2025collaborative introduced a hybrid
architecture augmenting pre-trained \acr{llm}s with task-specific embedding and prediction
layers. These layers, fine-tuned on domain data, align latent
representations of input-output pairs (denoted as `<x>` and `<y>` in
prompts), enabling the model to map chemical structures and properties
into a unified, interpretable space. Crucially, the added layers enhance
chemical reasoning without sacrificing the flexibility of
\acr{icl}, allowing the
system to adapt to trends across iterations, similarly to what was done
by @ramos2023bayesian. In their evaluations of molecular optimization
benchmarks, such as the \acr{pmo} \[@gao2022sample\], they revealed
improvements over conventional methods, including
\acr{bo}-\acr{gp}, \acr{rl} methods, and \acr{ga}.

@yu2025collaborative further highlighted the framework's extensibility
to diverse black-box optimization challenges beyond chemistry. This
represents one of the most important advantages of using
\acr{llm}s as orchestrators
of the optimization process. The flexibility of natural language in this
process enables the procedure to be applied to any optimization process.
In contrast, classical methods are constrained to the specific task for
which they are designed due to the need to train the surrogate model.

### LLMs as Next Candidate Generators

Recent studies demonstrate the potential of \acr{llm}s to enhance \acr{ea}s \[@lu2024generative\] and
\acr{bo}
\[@amin2025towards\] frameworks by leveraging their embedded chemical
knowledge and ability to integrate prior information, thereby reducing
computational effort while improving output quality. Within
\acr{ea}s,
\acr{llm}s refine molecular
candidates through mutations (modifying molecular substructures) or
crossovers (combining parent molecules). In \acr{bo} frameworks, they serve as acquisition
functions, utilizing surrogate model predictions---both mean and
uncertainty---to select optimal molecules or reaction conditions for
evaluation.

For molecule optimization, @yu2025collaborative introduced
`MultiModel`, a dual-\acr{llm} system where one model proposes
candidates and the other supplies domain knowledge (see
[1.4.3](#sec:opt-llm-know-source){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:opt-llm-know-source"}). By fine-tuning the "worker"
\acr{llm} to recognize
molecular scaffolds and target properties, and expanding the training
pool to include a million-size pre-training dataset, they achieved hit
rates exceeding $90\%$. Similarly, @wang2024efficient developed
`MoLLEO`, integrating an \acr{llm} into an \acr{ea} to replace random mutations with
\acr{llm}-guided
modifications. Here, `GPT-4` generated optimized offspring from parent
molecules, significantly accelerating convergence to high fitness
scores. Notably, while domain-specialized models (`BioT5`,
`MoleculeSTM`) underperformed, the general-purpose `GPT-4` excelled---a
finding that underscores the context-dependent utility of
\acr{llm}s

In a related approach, @lu2024generative showed that well-designed
prompts---incorporating task-specific constraints, objectives, and
few-shot examples---enable general \acr{llm}s (`Claude-Sonnet`, `o1-preview`) to generate
high-quality candidates without fine-tuning, outperforming both random
selection and vanilla \acr{ga}s in functional \acr{tmc} design.

### LLMs as Prior Knowledge Sources {#sec:opt-llm-know-source}

A key advantage of integrating \acr{llm}s into optimization frameworks is their
ability to encode and deploy prior knowledge within the optimization
loop. As illustrated in
[4](#fig:optimization){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="fig:optimization"}, this knowledge can be directed into
either the surrogate model or candidate generation module, significantly
reducing the number of optimization steps required through high-quality
guidance.

For example, @yu2025collaborative deployed a "research" agent that
leverages `Google` search and `RDKit` to verify and rank molecules
generated by "worker" agents against target features and properties.
Their results demonstrate substantial improvements when this filtering
mechanism is applied.

Similarly, @cisse2025language0based introduced `BORA`, which
contextualizes conventional black-box \acr{bo} using an \acr{llm}. `BORA` maintains standard
\acr{bo} as the core
driver but strategically activates the \acr{llm} when progress stalls. This leverages the
model's \acr{icl}
capabilities to hypothesize promising search regions and propose new
samples, regulated by a lightweight heuristic policy that manages costs
and incorporates domain knowledge (or user input). Evaluations on
synthetic benchmarks such as the catalyst optimization task for hydrogen
generation show that `BORA` accelerates exploration, improves
convergence, and outperforms existing \acr{llm}-\acr{bo} hybrids.

To enhance the task-specific knowledge of the \acr{llm} generating feedback, @zhang2025large
fine-tuned a `Llama-2-7B` model using a multitask
\acr{qa} dataset. This
dataset was created with instructions from `GPT-4`. The resulting model
served as a human assistant or operated within an active learning loop,
thereby accelerating the exploration of new reaction spaces (see
[1.3](#sec:retrosynthesis){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:retrosynthesis"}). However, as the authors note, even
this task-specialized \acr{llm}s produces suboptimal suggestions for
optimization tasks. They remain prone to hallucination and cannot assist
with unreported reactions, but still, they improve for most of the
applications, using pure classical methods.

### How to Face Optimization Problems?

Published works explore different ways of using
\acr{llm}s for optimization
problems in chemistry, from simple approaches, such as just prompting
the model with some initial random set of experimental candidates and
iterating \[@ramos2023bayesian\], to fine-tuning models in
\acr{bo} fashion
\[@rankovic2025gollum0\]. The most efficient initial point is by relying
entirely on a \acr{icl}
approach, which allows one to obtain a first signal rapidly. Such
initial results will enable to determine whether a more complex,
computationally intensive approach is necessary or whether prompt
engineering is reliable enough for the application. Fine-tuning can be
used as a way to enhance the chemical knowledge of the
\acr{llm}s and can lead to
improvements in optimization tasks where the model requires such
knowledge to choose or generate better candidates. Fine-tuning might not
be a game-changer for other approaches that rely more on sampling
methods \[@wang2025llm0augmented\].

While some initial works showed that \acr{llm}s trained specifically on chemistry perform
better for optimization tasks \[@kristiadi2024sober\], other works
showed that a \acr{gpm}
such as `GPT-4` combined with an \acr{ea} outperformed all other models
\[@wang2024efficient\]. Is it better to incorporate a general model or a
chemistry \acr{lm} into
the optimization frameworks? We hypothesize that for models of the same
size (in number of parameters) and similar training size---attending to
\acr{pflop}s---a chemical
\acr{lm} (a specialized
model) will consistently outperform general models. If the models differ
significantly in size, the larger model will typically perform better.
