# Implications of GPMs: Education, Safety, and Ethics {#sec:implications}

The advent of \acr{gpm}s in
the chemical sciences marks a paradigm shift that extends beyond
methodological advances to fundamentally alter the conceptual frameworks
through which scientific knowledge is produced and validated. As these
models permeate education and research, their transformative potential
is closely linked to critical challenges in cultivating discerning
learners, mitigating emergent risks in automated discovery, and
navigating ethical dilemmas arising from biased systems. Here, these
tripartite implications are examined, and it is argued that responsible
integration of \acr{gpm}s
requires not only technical innovation but also rigorous pedagogical and
regulatory frameworks.

## Education {#sec:education}

### Vision

\acr{gpm}s are opening up
new directions to create or use educational materials (see
[1](#fig:education){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="fig:education"}). Although many current applications are
still in their conceptual stage, they begin to highlight the potential
of these models to personalize learning, increase the fairness of
evaluations, and improve accessibility. \acr{gpm}s can support both students and educators at
various stages of the learning process and across different media forms,
indicating a shift toward more adaptive and personalized educational
frameworks. \[@Mollick2024\]

For students, \acr{gpm}s
could act as intelligent companions in a variety of tasks. As adaptive
tutors, they could tailor explanations, exercises, and feedback to
individual needs. Additionally, they could help students rehearse for
exams and presentations and deepen their conceptual understanding.

<figcaption><strong>Possible application examples for students and
teachers and their specific limitations for <span
data-acronym-label="gpm" data-acronym-form="plural+short">gpms</span> in
chemical education.</strong> \acr{gpm}s can be used by students as
scientific assistants (e.g., for data analysis, coding or lab
experiments) and tutors (e.g., for question answering, teaching or
exercises). Teachers can use \acr{gpm}s for evaluation (e.g., for
grading and detailed feedback) or to personalize materials (e.g., for
lectures and other learning materials). Current limitations include an
over-reliance and a lack of critical assessment of the outputs, a lack
of ready-to-use products, hallucination, a lack of reliability of the
models, and a technology knowledge deficit of the users.</figcaption>
</figure>

In more practice-oriented settings, such as laboratories or coding
environments, these models could function as scientific assistants. They
may provide real-time feedback on experimental setups, assist with how
to use lab equipment, or help identify potential safety
concerns.\[@Du2024\] Coupled with \acr{ar}, \acr{gpm}s could also enable immersive simulations of
lab procedures, allowing students to familiarize themselves with
workflows and instruments before entering a physical lab. Moreover, by
supporting students in technical areas such as coding, data analysis, or
simulations, they could reduce the entry barrier or learning curve and
thus foster interdisciplinary competence---particularly in contexts
where instructor support is limited.

At the same time, \acr{gpm}s could ease the workload of educators. They
offer new possibilities for generating and adapting course
materials---ranging from lecture slides and exercises to individualized
exam questions---thus enabling a better alignment with diverse learning
levels and prior knowledge. In assessment tasks, these models could
support the grading of open-ended responses by providing consistent,
criteria-based feedback and reducing subjective bias.\[@Kortemeyer2024;
@gao2024towards\] This is especially valuable in large courses or when
timely, detailed feedback would otherwise be difficult to provide.

### Current Status

Despite these envisioned potentials of \acr{gpm}s in chemistry education, current
applications are often still fragmented and lack integration into
cohesive educational systems. In many cases, models are used via
general-purpose interfaces without subject-specific customization or
alignment with curricular goals. Rather than being part of purpose-built
tools or platforms, their use remains largely exploratory.

#### General Systems

Early applications often rely on zero-shot prompting of general-purpose
\acr{llm}s or
\acr{vlm}s to aid with
student-oriented learning tasks. These include plotting data
\[@Subasinghe2025\], writing code \[@Tsai2023\], or generating analogies
to explain abstract chemical concepts \[@shao2025unlocking\].

@handa2025education analyzed over 570,000 anonymized Claude.ai
conversations from university-affiliated users, finding that students
primarily used the model for preparing learning materials ($39.3\%$) and
solving academic problems ($33.5\%$). However, their use was often
exploratory and low-stakes, and the study emphasizes the need for
guidance, as many users lacked the expertise to evaluate model outputs
critically.

Two recent studies have explored zero-shot prompting in more realistic,
assessment-focused settings. @baral2025drawedumath0 introduced a
benchmark of more than 2,000 student-drawn math images and found that
state-of-the-art \acr{vlm}s, including `GPT-4o` and `Claude 3.5`,
struggled to assess student reasoning and correctness, particularly in
open-ended or diagram-based answers. Similarly, @Kortemeyer2024
investigated the use of `GPT-4` for grading handwritten thermodynamics
exams at `ETH ZÃ¼rich`. While the model performed reasonably well on
short derivations, it failed to track detailed rubrics or interpret
hand-drawn diagrams reliably. In chemistry education,
@kharchenko2024advantages compared `ChatGPT 3.5`, `Gemini`, and
`Copilot` (detailed model names were not specified) on domain-specific
tasks and found that while the models performed adequately on simple
recall questions, they failed in tasks that required chemical reasoning,
structural understanding, or logical analysis.

Together, these findings suggest that while zero-shot prompting enables
rapid deployment of \acr{gpm}s in educational contexts, current models
lack the reliability, consistency, and domain grounding required for
chemistry education---not only from a pedagogical standpoint, but also
from ethical and legal perspectives.

#### Specialized Systems

A growing number of applications embed \acr{gpm}s in specialized educational systems that
combine \acr{gpm}s with
structured components such as \acr{rag}, tracking learning progress, or the
ability to work with multiple sources of content such as textbooks,
lecture slides, or handwritten notes.

For example, @perez2025large presented a biology
\acr{qa} system that used
a \acr{rag} pipeline to
deliver curriculum-aligned answers. The I-Digest team \[@Jablonka2023\]
introduced a platform that generates lecture summaries and follow-up
questions to support continuous learning. Some systems also integrate
specialized components to improve personalization and continuity in the
learning process. Although not designed for chemistry specifically,
general-purpose platforms such as TutorLLM \[@li2025tutorllm0\]
(generating personalized content based on the learning progress) and
LearnMate \[@wang2025learnmate0\] (creating learning plans and giving
feedback) demonstrate how large models can be embedded in structured
educational frameworks.

Anthropic's Claude for Education \[@AnthropicEducation\] offers a
purpose-built platform for higher education with a "Learning Mode" that
uses the Socratic method to guide students rather than directly giving
the answer to their queries. The intention here is to promote active
learning and mitigate the risks of passive tool use. While such systems
illustrate the potential of structured \acr{gpm}-based learning environments, fully
integrated applications remain rare---particularly in domain-specific
contexts such as chemistry. Furthermore, current models must still
strengthen their robustness and domain-specific reasoning before they
can be trusted in demanding fields, including chemistry.

### Outlook and Limitations

While \acr{gpm}s offer
promising opportunities for chemistry education, their use also raises
critical ethical and pedagogical concerns.

A first concern is the lack of transparency in how these models generate
responses. Although \acr{gpm}s produce fluent and plausible explanations,
they do so without genuine understanding---and often with no clear
indication of uncertainty or possible errors. This can lead students to
accept incorrect or misleading information as fact, particularly when
the output appears confident or authoritative. Over time, such
interactions may normalize uncritical acceptance and discourage students
from questioning, verifying, or reflecting on what they are told. In
scientific education, where reasoning, skepticism, and an evidence-based
mindset are essential, this poses a serious threat to the development of
informed and independent learners.\[@marcus2025will; @kosmyna2025your\]

A related but distinct issue is the risk of over-reliance and
deskilling. When students delegate a large portion of the learning
process to generative tools, they might be able to complete assignments
without engaging in the mental work needed to develop subject-specific
competence. In such cases, \acr{gpm}s can disrupt the connection between concrete
tasks---such as solving a problem or writing an explanation---and the
broader educational goals they are meant to support, such as developing
chemical understanding or analytical thinking
skills.\[@dung2025learning; @Sharma2025role\]

Today---and even more so in the future---students and learners will
increasingly use \acr{gpm}s, both in education and in their future
professions. Attempting to restrict their use is neither realistic nor
educationally meaningful. Therefore, educators must guide their use
thoughtfully and adapt both the learning process and assessment
practices accordingly. Furthermore, the question of what to learn needs
to be redefined. What we learn must increasingly center around the
development of critical thinking, creativity, and logical
reasoning---skills that remain essential and irreplaceable, even---or
perhaps especially---in the age of \acr{gpm}s. \[@klein2025rethink\]

## Safety {#sec:safety}

<figure id="fig:safety-overview">
<img src="media/figures/safety_chemrev_fig.png" alt="" / width="100%">
<figcaption><strong>A conceptual schematic depicting <span
data-acronym-label="ai" data-acronym-form="singular+short">ai</span>
risk factors in chemical science</strong>. As one traverses through the
game-like scientific process, there are various obstacles to
encountering \acr{ai} exacerbated risks. The path
to superaligned chemical \acr{ai}-assistants is obfuscated by
unexplored chemical space.</figcaption>
</figure>

A growing coalition within the scientific community has sounded a call
to action: \acr{ai} poses
existential risks that deserve the same urgent attention as pandemics
and nuclear war \[@cais2023statement\]. This call, formalized in a
statement signed by hundreds of prominent \acr{ai} researchers, reflects mounting
recognition that advanced \acr{ai} systems could fundamentally alter, or
threaten, human civilization. While the ongoing discourse has focused on
abstract notions of \acr{agi}, the immediate risks may emerge through
the integration of \acr{ai} into specific domains where the stakes
are already high \[@morris2023levels\].

Chemistry represents one such domain. The rapid integration of
\acr{gpm}s in chemistry is
a dual-edged sword. Although these technologies can accelerate
discovery, they also introduce unprecedented risks. From democratizing
access to hazardous chemical knowledge to enabling autonomous synthesis
of dangerous compounds, \acr{ai} systems could lower barriers for misuse,
whether intentional or accidental. \acr{gpm}s alone may not create new risks
\[@peppin2024reality\], but they can amplify existing ones (see
[2](#fig:safety-overview){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="fig:safety-overview"}).

Even in this amplified context, the ability of these systems to pose
meaningful safety risks in practice is constrained by real-world
limitations, including access to specialized lab equipment, regulated or
scarce reagents, and, most critically, the "tacit
knowledge"\[@Polanyi_2009\] required to execute complex chemical
processes. Tacit knowledge, the expertise gained through hands-on
experience and intuition, cannot be fully acquired from textbooks or
datasets alone, as it is normally shared verbally and encompasses small
learnings, often considered insignificant. This gap between theoretical
\acr{ai} outputs and
practical execution underscores why risks, though serious, might remain
manageable with proactive safeguards.

Ultimately, mitigating these threats requires a nuanced balance of
fostering innovation while embedding safety at the architectural,
operational, and governance levels.

### Evaluating Risk Amplification in the Chemical Discovery Cycle

#### Dual Use

A critical question is whether \acr{llm}s provide maliciously acting novices with new
avenues to obtain harmful knowledge beyond what is already easily
accessible (e.g., via the internet)\[@sandbrink2023artificial\].
Preliminary research has explored whether \acr{llm}s can exacerbate biorisks, a concern that
extends analogously to chemical safety under the "information access"
threat model \[@peppin2024reality\]. @urbina2022dual explored how their
de novo molecular generator, `MegaSyn`, could be used to design toxic
chemical agents by adjusting the reward system of the model to prefer
compounds with greater toxicity and bioactivity. While their model
predicted VX (toxic nerve agent) and other chemical warfare agents, the
actual synthesis of such compounds requires expertise, controlled
precursors, and specialized equipment that is far beyond the
capabilities of most non-state actors.

Recent evaluations by `OpenAI` and `Anthropic` have systematically
assessed how their models can facilitate the creation of biological
threats. In an evaluation of their Deep Research System (a multi-agent
architecture), `OpenAI` classified the system to be medium-risk for
chemical and biological threat-creation. \[@openai2024building\] As
discussed previously, a key barrier that prevents such models from
exceeding the assessed risk threshold is the acquisition of "tacit
knowledge". However, this system demonstrated modest improvements in
troubleshooting and the acquisition of tacit knowledge. Although it
still fell short of expert-level performance, these findings suggest
that models are making progress toward overcoming this critical hurdle.
They also evaluated `GPT-4`'s impact on experts and students across five
biological threat creation stages: ideation, acquisition, magnification,
formulation, and release. \[@openai2024building\] Their key finding was
that biorisk information is widely accessible without
\acr{ai} and that
practical constraints such as wet lab access or domain expertise are
more limiting than information scarcity.

`Anthropic`'s parallel assessment of `Claude 4 Opus` focused
specifically on biological risks through red-teaming with bio-defense
experts, multi-step agentic evaluations, and explicit testing of
bioinformatics tool integration \[@anthropic2025system\]. Their findings
align with `OpenAI`'s assessment of `GPT-4`, and conclude that current
systems remain constrained by physical barriers. Both studies emphasize
that supply chain control of chemicals, the flow of goods (e.g.,
chemical reagents) from suppliers to consumers, remains crucial as these
systems continue to evolve and barriers to accessing knowledge are
continuously lowered. For example, although @he2023control showed that
\acr{llm}s can generate
pathways for explosives like \acr{petn} or nerve agents like sarin, the supply
chain of obtaining precursor chemicals for weapons like sarin is tightly
regulated. In addition, access to lab infrastructure like fume hoods or
inert environments is not trivial to obtain for non-experts.

In the status quo it remains true that these risks are mitigated by
material and logistical hurdles \[@sandbrink2023artificial\].
Nonetheless, existing information access or presumed barriers to
accessing materials are not an argument for \acr{ai} complacency. Models that lower the
technical or cognitive barriers to weaponization even incrementally risk
acting as force multipliers for malicious actors. Moreover, a
red-teaming (discussed in
[\[para:red_teaming\]](#para:red_teaming){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="para:red_teaming"}) effort proved that these practical
constraints are circumventable and show that real world checks are prone
to failure.

#### Hallucinations

Another critical risk of \acr{gpm}s is their propensity for hallucination,
leading to factually incorrect outputs.\[@pantha2024challenges;
@ji2023survey\] These errors risk propagating misinformation, such as
inventing non-existent chemical reactions or falsifying safety
protocols. Additionally, \acr{llm}s suffer from temporal misalignment; their
static training data renders outputs obsolete in fast-evolving fields
like drug discovery \[@pantha2024challenges\]. Therefore, their accuracy
in chemistry decays sharply for research published after the training
cutoff, underscoring the need for real-time verification systems.

#### Indirect Cyberattack Risk

The convergence of individual steps of the chemical discovery cycle in
autonomous laboratory systems or cloud-based laboratories represents a
high-risk scenario \[@rouleau2025risks\]. Beyond traditional
cybersecurity threats, these systems face a critical timeline mismatch:
\acr{ai} systems are
projected to achieve superhuman hacking capabilities by 2027 while
operating within inadequately secured infrastructure
\[@dean2025security\]. For autonomous laboratories, this means
\acr{ai} systems capable
of designing hazardous compounds could be compromised by external
actors.

### Existing Approaches to Safety

Adversarial testing and red teaming have become prominent methods for
evaluating the safety of \acr{ai} systems, even in the chemical domain (see
[\[sec:evals\]](#sec:evals){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="sec:evals"}). While such evaluations are valuable to identify
weaknesses in \acr{gpm}s,
they are inherently reactive. These approaches highlight failures only
after a model is trained or deployed, rather than embedding safety into
the model's architecture. Moreover, adversarial testing is often
unsystematic and relies on human-curated test cases that may not range
across all potential risks, particularly in complex domains such as
chemistry.

To move beyond reactive measures, an emerging field of safety research
explores machine "unlearning", a technique that selectively removes
hazardous knowledge from a model's training data \[@barez2025open\].
However, this approach faces significant challenges in chemistry. First,
defining "dangerous chemical knowledge" is non-trivial because chemical
properties are context-dependent. Seemingly benign compounds like bleach
can become hazardous when combined or misused. Second, unlearning risks
can lead to a model's utility degradation, and the resulting challenge
of balancing the trade-off between safety and functionality remains
unresolved. This balance is especially challenging for
\acr{gpm}s, which must
achieve broad applicability with strict safety constraints.

A more implicit safety strategy is alignment, which aims to steer model
behavior toward human values through techniques like
\acr{rlhf} or
Constitutional \acr{ai}
\[@bai2022constitutional\]. Although alignment can reduce harmful
outputs, it may not generalize well to novel or domain-specific threats.
For instance, a chemically aligned model might refuse to synthesize a
known toxin, but could still be manipulated into suggesting precursor
chemicals. Moreover, even after undergoing alignment training, they are
still prone to produce risky and harmful content and will always be
susceptible to jailbreaks \[@kuntz2025os-harm; @yona2024stealing;
@lynch2025agentic\].

In an effort to train trustworthy models, many \acr{ai} researchers have turned to
"interpretability", an approach that aims to explain how the
computations \acr{gpm}s are
linked to the output. \[@cunningham2023sparse\] However, in a recent
global evaluation of \acr{ai} safety, @bengio2025international argue
that \acr{sota}
interpretability tools have not proven their reliability in
understanding models to modify them to alleviate safety
risks.\[@makelov2023subspace\]

#### Challenges in Developing Safeguards

Even chemistry-specific \acr{llm}s agents like `ChemCrow`
\[@bran2024augmenting\] or `Coscientist`\[@boiko2023autonomous\] exhibit
vulnerabilities. For instance, `ChemCrow`'s safeguards block known
controlled substances, yet @he2023control demonstrated a flaw in its
safety protocols. The agent's refusals are reactive rather than
proactive, as they rely on post-query web search checks rather than
embedded safeguards.

The capabilities and ensuing risks posed by \acr{gpm}s need to be contextualized around user
intent \[@tang2024prioritizing\]. Under a paradigm of malicious intent,
the user intentionally creates a dangerous situation or application
using the tool. However, an uninformed, benign user (e.g., a chemistry
undergraduate student) could be unaware of the dangers posed by a given
model output and unable to differentiate hallucinated responses.

### Solutions

The gaps in current \acr{ai} safety measures reveal a pressing need
for proactive frameworks that address technical and systemic risks.
\[@bengio2025international\]

#### Regulatory Framework for Chemical \acr{ai} Models

Drawing from emerging biosecurity governance models, as a first step,
chemical \acr{ai}
oversight should focus on a narrow class of "advanced chemical models"
that meet specific risk thresholds. Similar to proposed biological model
regulations, these could include models trained on not widely
accessible, particularly sensitive chemical data \[@bloomfield2024ai\].
This targeted approach is preferable to regulating all chemical
\acr{ai} models because it
avoids creating compliance burdens that would disproportionately affect
low-risk research while capturing the systems that actually pose
security concerns.

#### Existing Institutional Efforts

Recent governmental initiatives have begun to address
\acr{ai} safety concerns.
The US \acr{ai} Safety
Institute \[@nist2024safety\] and the UK \acr{ai} Safety Institute have been tasked with
designing safety evaluations for frontier models and researching
catastrophic risks from \acr{ai} systems. In contrast, the
\acr{eu} has taken a more
pragmatic regulatory approach through the \acr{eu} \acr{ai} Act \[@EU2024regulation\], which
classifies \acr{ai}
systems by risk levels and imposes obligations ranging from transparency
requirements to prohibited uses. These nascent efforts, while promising,
face significant limitations. National institutes operate within
frameworks that may prioritize domestic interests over global safety.
While more comprehensive in scope, the \acr{eu} \acr{ai} Act focuses primarily on general
\acr{ai} applications
rather than domain-specific risks such as chemical synthesis, and its
risk classification system may not adequately capture the unique
dual-use nature of chemical \acr{ai} models.

#### Future Institutional Oversight and Transparency

A critical step forward is establishing neutral and independent
regulatory bodies to oversee \acr{ai} development. Unlike self-regulation,
which risks conflicts of interest, an \acr{iaio} comprised of \acr{ai} researchers, policymakers, ethicists, and
security experts could harmonize standards and prevent a "race to the
bottom" in regulatory laxity \[@trager2023international\]. Such a body
could mandate pre-approval for high-risk \acr{ai} research (like \acr{agi}-aligned projects), similar to
institutional review boards that exist in the biomedical research space
\[@pistono2016unethical\]. Precedents for this exist in
\acr{cern}, which tries
to balance civilian duties with dual-use risks and nuclear
non-proliferation treaties that tie market access to
compliance.\[@cern_nuclear_safeguards_2024\] Effective governance also
requires binding enforcement mechanisms. One approach is conditional
market access, where \acr{ai} products and precursors can only be
traded internationally if certified by the \acr{iaio}. Participating states would then enact
domestic laws to align with these standards, ensuring corporate and
national compliance. This model leverages economic incentives rather
than voluntary guidelines to enforce safety. Transparency must also be
enforced, particularly in red-teaming and safety testing. Currently,
many companies conduct red-teaming privately, with no obligation to
disclose the findings or corrective actions. To address this,
\acr{ai} developers should
be required to publicly report red-teaming results and undergo
third-party safety audits for high-stakes
applications.\[@carlini2025career\]

The risks posed by \acr{ai} in chemistry demand immediate action from
governments and institutions. Yet these challenges also invite a deeper
question: *Is the integration of \acr{ai} into scientific discovery fundamentally
advancing our understanding or merely accelerating the production of
epistemic noise?* As @narayanan2025why cautioned,
\acr{ai}'s predictive
abilities often obscure its inability to explain underlying mechanisms.
In chemistry, this tension is acute: \acr{ai}-driven tools may optimize reactions or
design toxins with equal ease, but their black-box nature complicates
accountability and obscures causal relationships. True progress may
require safeguards against misuse and a reevaluation of whether
\acr{ai}'s role in science
should be expansive or deliberately constrained.

## Ethics {#sec:ethics}

The deployment of \acr{gpm}s in the chemical sciences raises several
critical ethical concerns that require careful consideration. These
issues range from perpetuating harmful biases to environmental impacts
and intellectual property concerns \[@crawford2021atlas\].

### Environmental Impact and Climate Ethics

The computational requirements for training and deploying
\acr{gpm}s contribute to
environmental degradation through excessive energy consumption and
carbon emissions. \[@spotte-smith2025considering; @nature2023carbon\]
These computational resources are often powered by fossil fuel-based
energy sources, which directly contribute to anthropogenic climate
change. \[@strubell2019energy\] The emphasis on \acr{ai} research has superseded some of the
commitments made by big technological companies to carbon neutrality.
For example, Google rescinded its commitment to carbon neutrality amid a
surge in \acr{ai} usage
(65$\%$ increase in carbon emissions between 2021-24) and
funding.\[@bhuiyan2025google\] Additionally, the water consumption for
cooling data centers that support these models is another concern,
particularly in regions facing water scarcity. \[@mytton2021data\]

The irony is particularly stark when considering that in the chemical
sciences, these models are used to address climate-related challenges,
such as the development of sustainable materials or carbon capture
technologies. As a scientific community, we must grapple with the
questions about the sustainability of current \acr{ai} development trajectories and consider
more efficient and renewable approaches to model development and
deployment. \[@kolbert2024obscene\]

### Copyright Infringement and Plagiarism Concerns

\acr{gpm}s are typically
trained on a vast corpora of copyrighted scientific literature, patents,
and proprietary databases, often without explicit permission, a practice
that has sparked legal disputes, such as *Getty Images v.Â Stability
\acr{ai}*, where
plaintiffs allege unauthorized scraping of protected content.
\[@kirchhubel2024intellectual\] Developers at `OpenAI` claimed in a
statement to the \acr{uk}
House of Lords that training \acr{sota} models is "impossible" without
copyrighted material, highlighting a fundamental tension between
\acr{ip} law and
\acr{ai} advancement.
\[@openai2023written\] In the chemical sciences, this challenge persists
through the training of models on experimental results from pay-walled
journals. A potential resolution to this in the scientific sphere lies
in the expansion of open-access research frameworks. Initiatives like
the \acr{cas} Common
Chemistry database provide legally clear training data while maintaining
attribution. \acr{llm}s
have shown a high propensity to regurgitate elements from their training
data. When generating text, models may reproduce near-verbatim fragments
of training data without citation, effectively obscuring intellectual
contributions.\[@bender2021dangers\] While some praise
\acr{gpm}s for overcoming
"blank-page syndrome" for early-career scientists
\[@altmae2023artificial\], others warn that uncritical reliance on their
outputs risks eroding scientific rigor.\[@donker2023dangers\]

### Bias and Discrimination

\acr{gpm}s inherit and
amplify harmful prejudices and stereotypes present in their training
data, which pose significant risks when applied translationally to
medicinal chemistry and biochemistry. \[@spotte-smith2025considering;
@yang2024demographic; @omiye2023large\] These models can perpetuate
inaccurate and harmful assumptions based on race and gender about drug
efficacy, toxicity, and disease susceptibility, leading to misdiagnosis
and mistreatment. \[@chen2023algorithmic\] Historical medical literature
contains biased representations of how different populations respond to
treatments, and \acr{gpm}s
trained on such data can reinforce these misconceptions.
\[@mittermaier2023bias\] The problem extends to broader contexts in
chemical research. Biased models can influence research priorities,
funding decisions, and the development of chemical tools in ways that
systematically disadvantage the most vulnerable populations
\[@dotan2019value0laden\].

#### Solutions

The problem of bias can be best addressed through top-down reform. The
data necessary to train unbiased models can only exist if clinical
studies of drug efficacy are conducted on diverse populations in the
real world.\[@criado-perez2019invisible\] To complement improved data
collection, standard evaluations for bias testing must be developed and
mandated prior to deployment of \acr{gpm}s.

### Democratization of Power

Although \acr{ai} tools
have the potential to democratize access to advanced chemical research
capabilities, they may also concentrate power in the hands of a few
large companies that control the frontier models. This concentration
raises concerns about equitable access to research tools, particularly
for researchers in smaller institutions with limited
resources.\[@satariano2025a1i1\]
