zero- or few-shot prompted or fine-tuned <span data-acronym-label="gpm"

be solved by combining multiple <span data-acronym-label="gpm"

execution trajectory is pre-determined. In agents, <span
data-acronym-label="gpm" data-acronym-form="plural+short">gpms</span>
autonomously decide on the execution trajectory and in this way enable
researchers to address open-ended tasks. Moving forward, coupling the
validation closer to real-world objectives with further increased
validation in better, custom user interfaces will enhance the impact of

deployment, the community must engage with the broader public and

As we have explored in this review, [gpms]{acronym-label="gpm"
acronym-form="plural+short"}---especially [llms]{acronym-label="llm"
acronym-form="plural+short"}---hold remarkable promise for the chemical
sciences. The field moved from using models in simple single calls to a
[gpms]{acronym-label="gpm" acronym-form="plural+short"} to developing
workflows, in which a sequence of calls is performed, to increasingly
complex autonomous agents in which the model decides on its own
trajectory (see [1](#fig:conclusions){reference-type="ref+Label"
reference="fig:conclusions"}). To power those agents, increasingly
powerful models are being built, including reasoning models that promise
higher data efficiency.

Yet, several fundamental questions remain unresolved. We do not
understand if there are fundamental limits to what can be predicted,
given the inherent unpredictability of chemical systems and the reliance
on tacit knowledge. We do not know what new datasets and techniques need
to be developed, given the fact that the knowledge we extract from
already published data is approaching a limit.\[@silver2025welcome\] New
data most likely will be generated by agents learning from their own
experience. To optimize systems, we need to better understand the
underlying structure of chemical data. In many other fields, data
distributions have been shaped by special driving forces. For example,
evolution led to a direct link between sequence and fitness in
biological sequences, which makes such datasets special. In chemistry it
is unclear what the "driving force" that shapes datasets is.

It is also unclear how quickly these innovations will permeate the
average chemistry lab, where the adoption of new technology depends on
more than just predictive prowess. And we also do not know yet how we
should interface with those models for the greatest effectiveness. In
addition, it is also unclear how far acceleration can take us, as nature
imposes some natural speed limits: Some experiments simply take their
time.

Overall, this landscape suggests a future rich with opportunity. But
realizing the potential impact of [gpms]{acronym-label="gpm"
acronym-form="plural+short"} demands clear-eyed caution: while it is now
deceptively easy to spin up prototypes, transforming them into robust,
reliable tools is a far more arduous task. \[@sculley2014machine\] More
crucial still is our need for rigorous measurement and
feedback---whether in the construction of evaluation suites, the
calibration of reward functions for reinforcement learning, or the
design of sensible governance. No single discipline can shoulder this
alone; chemists, policy experts, and computer scientists must broaden
their ranks and collaborate. This is particularly since science has
always benefited from embracing a diversity of approaches. While
[gpm]{acronym-label="gpm" acronym-form="singular+short"}-powered
approaches for science, such as "AI scientists", hold promise, a myopic
focus on "AI scientists" might lead to "scientific
monocultures".\[@Savitsky_2025\] We hope this review lowers the barrier
to entry to the background and applications of
[gpms]{acronym-label="gpm" acronym-form="plural+short"} in the chemical
sciences, inviting a wider spectrum of contributors to adopt a
systems-science mindset---and, in doing so, to help harness the best of
what [gpms]{acronym-label="gpm" acronym-form="plural+short"} can offer
for tackling the chemical sciences' most persistent and pressing
challenges.
